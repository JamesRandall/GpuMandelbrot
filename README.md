An example of using WebGL to render the famous Mandelbrot with a fragment shader on the GPU.

I will be writing about how this works shortly but in the meantime the basic concepts of using graphics APIs such as OpenGL can be found in my book Game Engine Development in C#, the work in progress of which is available on my [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jamesrandall).
